Changes in 1.0.8
----------------
	* corrected race with close, found by Sun QA in anticipation
	  of commit to Solaris.
	* make sure we kick the poll-demand register on ADMtek chips
	  when finishing up receive (guard against rx stall).

Changes in 1.0.7
----------------
	* added interrupt kstats, which allows vmstat -i to show these
	  devices.  Note that to avoid namespace collision, the interrupts
	  are listed as "mxfecXX" and "afecXX".  This is similar to the way
	  standard hme interfaces work.

Changes in 1.0.6
----------------
	* more devices supported/identified

Changes in 1.0.5
----------------
	* switch to Studio 11 compilers
	* cleaned up some compiler options
	* rework transmit logic slightly, hopefully fix transmit side hang
	  (this change reenables per-packet transmit complete interrupts, so
	  expect more interrupt activity)
	* added detection of a few new cards (NC100, 3Com SOHO, etc.)
	* removed lots of debug code I never use (CSR, MII, and PCI etherdiag)
	* srom dump (-E) removed from etherdiag, replaced with NDD "srom"
	* various bugs in etherdiag fixed
	* remove debug noise in mxfe
	* added PERFORMANCE notes

Changes in 1.0.4
----------------
	* added support for AMD64 instruction set
	* fixed compilation error/warning in detach

Changes in 1.0.3
----------------
	* disabled broken fiber autodetection in afe (use fiber=1 in afe.conf)
	* converted source code to use CVS/RCS ident information
	* updated website references to point at sourceforge
	* etherdiag now has -n <parameters> to support ndd-like functionality
	* mxfe link detection logic rewritten
	* mxfe gets ndd support like afe has

Changes in 1.0.2
----------------
	* new style copyright
	* fix warning when add_drv doesn't have hardware present
	* built for x86 and SPARC

Changes in 1.0.1
----------------
	* primarily added ndd support for afe (mxfe not supported yet)
	* rewrote some of the link logic in AFE to be more robust
	* fix error in mxfe due to no memcpy, etc. when built with gcc

Changes in 0.9.17
------------------
	* ripped out Macronix and PNIC support (now in separate packages)
	* fixed lost mblk bug worked around in 0.9.13 with a proper fix
	* reverted to prior pre-GLD architecture (backed out all changes
	  since 0.9.13

Changes in 0.9.14-0.9.16
------------------------
	* this was an abortive development chain (backed out in 0.9.17)
	* converted to GLD, which required Solaris 8 update 2 for SPARC users
	* major architectural changes to support GLD
	* was completely broken on Solaris x86.
	* attempt at PNIC support -- will be reincarnated as a new
	  "pnic" driver and package later.

Changes in 0.9.13
-----------------
	* workaround a lost mblk bug that was causing poor performance
	  in certain situations

Changes in 0.9.12
-----------------
	* fix a severe memory leak (100% leakage of outbound traffic)
	* performance fixes for IPv4 and IPv6

Changes in 0.9.11
-----------------
	* lost track of individual changes since 0.9.6
	* added support for Centaur-II and Accton chips
	* autodetect SROM width
	* somewhere in here I added abortive support for
	* more afediag enhancements
	* fixed SPARC support
	* first binary distributions

Changes in 0.9.6
--------------
	* added -e switch to afediag to get EEPROM contents
	* new afediag utility

Changes in 0.9.5
----------------
	* forgot to update this file, so changes included in 0.9.5 are here
	* lots of bugs fixed
	* added man pages
	* packaging changes
	* improved link state change notification on Centaur and Comet
	* code generalizations
	* new diagnostic utility (afediag) and man page

Changes in 0.9.1
----------------
	* added tunables for link mode, and documented them in man page.
	* various bug fixes
	* better link state change notification
	* reduced number of tx interrupts
	* missed frame counter now updated properly

Changes in 0.9.0
----------------
	* tunables are now properties.  still need to document these in
	  the man page or a driver.conf file.
	* reduced unnecessary chip and transceiver resets.
	* added feature to set link mode.

Changes in 0.1.3
----------------
	* added phytimer to detect and report link state changes
	* turned off almost all debug noise (warning items are still
	  reported).
	* support for reading Comet MII registers (untested)
	* backenabling queues when buffers become available again after
	  running out.
	* converted to BitKeeper, use SCCS keywords

Changes in 0.1.2
----------------
	* converted to BSD style license (was GPL)
	* packaging improvements (minor)
	* IP speed enhancements (both v4 and v6)
	* added afe.7d man page (SGML) -- not yet packaged
	* reduced message logging (debug build only)
	* workaround ADMtek TX stall bug
