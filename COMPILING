INSTALL
-------

1) If you do not already have them, download from Sun and install
   the Studio 11 compilers.  These are free from Sun.

      Note: While in theory it should be possible to use recent versions
      of gcc (3.3 or better), I've heard of problems resulting from GCC
      on amd64 that cleared up after switching to the Sun Studio 11 compilers.  

2) Make your path look like this:

	/usr/ccs/bin:/usr/xpg4/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/ccs/bin

   Assuming you are using csh, you could this:

	% setenv PATH /usr/ccs/bin:/usr/xpg4/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/ccs/bin

   Note that there is nothing else in this path, and most especially that
   /usr/ucb is *not* on the path.

3) Append the location where you installed the Sun compilers to the path.
   If you installed them in the default location of /opt/SUNWspro, and you
   are using csh, you could use this command:

	% setenv PATH ${PATH}:/opt/SUNWspro/bin

   (Assuming you installed the Studio 11 compilers in the default location of
   /opt/SUNWspro/bin.  If you installed them elsewhere, adjust the path
   appropriately.)

4) You can verify that you have the Sun make, and that you are not using
   GNU make (which will NOT WORK), by doing this:

	% what `which make`

   which should look something like this:

        RELEASE VERSION SunOS 5.10 Patch 118677-01 March 2005

   (Obviously it will be different if you build on different releases of
   Solaris.)

5) You can verify that you are using Sun Studio 11 by this command:

	% cc -V

   which should look this:

	cc: Sun C 5.8 2005/10/13
	usage: cc [ options] files.  Use 'cc -flags' for details

6) In this directory, build the software using this command

	% make package

7) This will create a directory called "pkgdir.i386" or "pkgdir.sparc",
   depending on which platform you are building on.

8) Become root using "su":

	% su
	Password:
	#

9) Install the packages you built in step 6.

	# pkgadd -d pkgdir.`uname -p` all

10) You can now use the device as any ethernet.  Please see the
    Administrator's Guide for more information about configuring your network
    interface.

UNINSTALL
---------

To remove the package, remove any /etc/hostname.afeXX and /etc/hostname.mxfeXX
references (unplumb the network), and then run

	# pkgrm GEDenetd GEDenetu GEDenetm

You may need to reboot to properly clean up, but saavy users can use "ifconfig"
and "modunload" to skip this step.
