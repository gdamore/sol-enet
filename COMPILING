INSTALL
-------

I've only tested this release using the Sun Studio 11 compilers.  It should
be possible to use recent versions of gcc (3.3 or better) and possibly even
older versions of the Sun compilers (depending upon which platform you are
building for.)  In any case, the Sun Studio 11 compilers are freely available
without any unreasonable limitation from Sun, so I recommend you use those, as
this is the compiler that Sun uses to build Solaris itself.

If you have updated information about compiler options, etc., please let me
know.  However, please don't bother me if you are just having trouble building
the package from source -- especially if you are not using Sun Studio 11 or
better -- instead JUST USE THE BINARY RELEASES.

To build using the Sun Studio compilers:

	1) Ensure that "cc" is on your path and is Studio 11 or newer.  It
	   *must not* be /usr/ucb/cc.  (Take /usr/ucb out of your path
	   for this build.  In fact, I recommend taking /usr/ucb out of
	   your path forever.  If you still use some utilities there, create
	   a specific alias.  /usr/ucb is "evil" in many regards.)

	2) Ensure that "make" is on your path, and is /usr/ccs/bin/make.
	   NOTE: YOU MUST USE SUN'S MAKE, GNUMAKE WILL NOT WORK!!!

	3) In this directory, type "make package".

	4) This will create a directory called "pkgdir.i386" or "pkgdir.sparc",
	   depending on which platform you are building on.

	5) Become root using the "su" program.

	6) pkgadd -d pkgdir.`uname -p` all

	7) you can now use the device as any ethernet; create a file for it
	   as /etc/hostname.afe0 (or whatever) and stick an IP address in
	   it.

	8) You may wish to reboot at this point to ensure that the
	   driver is plumbed properly underneath IP.  (If you are saavy with
	   ifconfig(1M), you can skip this step, but you knew that, right?)

To build using GCC *UNSUPPORTED*:

	1) Make sure you have a recent (e.g. 3.4.x) version of GCC
	   with both 32 and 64 bit support compiled in.  Note that as
	   of this writing the version supplied by blastwave on x86
	   does *not* include 64-bit support.)  Also, make sure that gcc
	   is on your path.

	2) Ensure that "make" is on your path, and is /usr/ccs/bin/make.
	   NOTE: YOU MUST USE SUN'S MAKE, GNUMAKE WILL NOT WORK!!!

	3) In this directory, type "make -e STUDIO= package"
	   NOTE: the full arguments here are required to ensure that the
	   Makefiles do not attempt to use the Sun compilers.

	4) Follow the steps as for the Sun Studio compilers above, starting
	   at step #4.

UNINSTALL
---------

To remove the package, remove any /etc/hostname.afeXX and /etc/hostname.mxfeXX
references (unplumb the network), and then run

	# pkgrm GEDenetd GEDenetu GEDenetm

You may need to reboot to properly clean up, but saavy users can use "ifconfig"
and "modunload" to skip this step.
