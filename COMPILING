INSTALL
-------

To install from source, you *MUST* use either gcc 3.2.1 or newer, or
Sun Forte C 6 or newer.  In this release, gcc is presumed to be the default.
Older compilers will *NOT* work.

Steps (assuming the GNU C Compiler):

	1) ensure that "gcc" is on your path and is GCC 3.2.1 or newer.

	2) ensure that "make" is on your path, and is /usr/ccs/bin/make.
	   NOTE: YOU MUST USE SUN'S MAKE, GNUMAKE WILL NOT WORK!!!

	3) in this directory, type "make package"

	4) this will create a directory called "pkgdir.i386" or "pkgdir.sparc",
	   depending on which platform you are building on.

	5) become root using the "su" program

	6) pkgadd -d pkgdir.`uname -p` all

	7) you can now use the device as any ethernet; create a file for it
	   as /etc/hostname.afe0 (or whatever) and stick an IP address in
	   it.

	8) You may wish to reboot at this point to ensure that the
	   driver is plumbed properly underneath IP.  (If you are saavy with
	   ifconfig(1M), you can skip this step, but you knew that, right?)

To build using the Forte (aka SunONE) compilers:

	1) ensure that "cc" is on your path and is Forte 6 or newer.  It
	   *must not* be /usr/ucb/cc.  (Take /usr/ucb out of your path
	   for this build.  In fact, I recommend taking /usr/ucb out of
	   your path forever.  If you still use some utilities there, create
	   a specific alias.  /usr/ucb is "evil" in many regards.)

	2) ensure that "make" is on your path, and is /usr/ccs/bin/make.
	   NOTE: YOU MUST USE SUN'S MAKE, GNUMAKE WILL NOT WORK!!!

	3) in this directory, type "make -e GCC= package"
	   NOTE: the full arguments here are required to ensure that the
	   Makefiles do not attempt to use GCC.

	4) Follow the above procedure starting at step 4.

UNINSTALL
---------

To remove the package, remove any /etc/hostname.afeXX and /etc/hostname.mxfeXX
references (unplumb the network), and then run

	# pkgrm GEDenetd GEDenetu GEDenetm

You may need to reboot to properly clean up, but saavy users can use "ifconfig"
and "modunload" to skip this step.
