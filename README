Garrett's Fast Ethernet Drivers README
======================================

Please read the included User's Guide, which is supplied in PDF, HTML,
and PostScript (see the files GUIDE.pdf, GUIDE.html, and GUIDE.ps).  This
document includes detailed installation instructions, and following it may
make the installation process much simpler.

General Info
------------

These drivers support the following hardware/OS configurations:

	* UltraSPARC based systems: Solaris 8 and later, including
	  OpenSolaris.  Solaris 8 users may need to apply patch 109202-01 or
	  newer.  This patch can be found at http://sunsolve.sun.com

	* Intel i386 based systems and clones: Solaris 7 and later, including
	  OpenSolaris.

	* AMD Opteron (amd64) based systems and clones: Solaris 10 and later,
	  including OpenSolaris.

Note that only Solaris and derived operating systems are supported.
You cannot use these drivers with Windows, Linux, MacOS, etc.  If you
are looking for drivers for one of those operating systems, please see
your NIC vendor.  Typically drivers for these operating systems will
be supplied by the manufacturer on their web site as well as in media
included with the NIC itself.

These drivers support several different chips:

	* ADMtek AN983 (Centaur-P)
	* ADMtek AN985 (Centaur-C)
	* ADMtek ADM9511 (Centaur-II, software modem)
	* ADMtek ADM9513 (Centaur-II, hardware modem)
	* ADMtek AL981 (Comet, untested)
	* Accton EN5251 (Centaur-P)
	* Lite-On PNIC-II
	* Macronix 98715 family
	* Macronix 98725

For the multifunction chips (Centaur-II), only ethernet functionality
is supported.  I've done various amounts of testing with the Centaur
chips.  ADMtek has done some testing with the Centaur-II's and Accton
has also done some testing with the EN5251.

For more up-to-date information, including which specific NICs are
supported, please see

Note that these drivers do not support network booting as a client (you
can still use this driver on boot servers).
