Garrett's Fast Ethernet Drivers README
======================================

Please read the included User's Guide, which is supplied in PDF, HTML,
and PostScript (see the files GUIDE.pdf, GUIDE.html, and GUIDE.ps).  This
document includes detailed installation instructions, and following it may
make the installation process much simpler.

General Info
------------

These drivers support several different chips:

	* ADMtek AN983 (Centaur-P)
	* ADMtek AN985 (Centaur-C)
	* ADMtek ADM9511 (Centaur-II, software modem)
	* ADMtek ADM9513 (Centaur-II, hardware modem)
	* ADMtek AL981 (Comet, untested)
	* Accton EN5251 (Centaur-P)
	* Lite-On PNIC-II
	* Macronix 98715 family
	* Macronix 98725

For the multifunction chips (Centaur-II), only ethernet functionality
is supported.  I've done various amounts of testing with the Centaur
chips.  ADMtek has done some testing with the Centaur-II's and Accton
has also done some testing with the EN5251.

For more up-to-date information, please see

These drivers support Solaris 8 and later on SPARC, and Solaris 7 and later
on x86 platforms.

Solaris 8 users on SPARC may need to apply patch 109202-01 or
newer.  This patch can be found at http://sunsolve.sun.com/

Note that these drivers do not support network booting as a client (you
can still use this driver on boot servers).
